# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
Learning. I learn the most when I fail, and I sure did that a lot this week.

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
I learned what API's are. I never knew, probably because I never understood them in context. I'm amazed there are so many and how they are so widely used. I think it's awesome.

- What are you struggling with?
Chasing errors effectively and fully understanding the data flow in MVC. But I had a great tutor session with Savannah on Thursday, which helped a lot with my understanding of both of those issues. They have gone hand in hand this week and I think now I have a better understanding of why. My partner project with Kyle helped a lot also. He does things in a slightly different order than Jeremy, who does them differently than Mick, etc.. As I get a better understanding of the way data moves around in the MVC structure, I hope to get a better grasp on why different approaches can be effective in different situations.

- What would you count as a victory?
With every mistake that I make, I learn more about how to fix them, or avoid them altogether. I'd like to be performing so much better than I am but I guess learning the hard way isn't as bad as it feels sometimes. As long as I'm learning. 
My biggest mistakes are the ones I'll never forget. I'm grateful for that, but it's a painful trade-off.
I'm looking forward to our one week break which I can hopefully use to catch up on my understanding of the things that I've struggling with. 
Maybe I'll even get the chance to revisit some of my previous projects that I'd like to improve on. That would be a huge victory.
But that will have to wait until I complete my week 4 checkpoint. I haven't aced one yet. I'd really like to this time.
