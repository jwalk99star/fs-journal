# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
Learning. I learn the most when I fail, and I did that a lot this week.

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
I learned what API's are. I never knew, probably because I never understood them in context. I'm amazed there are so many and how they are used. I think it's awesome.

- What are you struggling with?


- What would you count as a victory?
With every mistake that I make, I learn more about how to fix them, or avoid them altogether. I'd like to be performing better but I guess learning the hard way isn't that bad, as long as I'm learning. I'm looking forward to our one week break which I can hopefully use to catch up and maybe even revisit some of the projects that I'd like to improve on. That would be a huge victory.
But all that will have to wait until I complete my week 4 checkpoint. I haven't aced one yet. I'd really like to this time.
