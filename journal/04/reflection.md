# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
Learning. I learn the most when I fail, and I did that a lot this week.

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
I learned what API's are. I never knew, probably because I never understood them in context. I'm amazed there are so many and how they are used. I think it's awesome.

- What are you struggling with?
What I would call 'rookie mistakes'. I missed 3 requirements on my checkpoint from week three. Foolish mistakes that I made because I didn't follow the instructions as closely as I should have and probably could have if I had been more intentional. I felt good about the checkpoint when I left on Friday but early on Saturday I wrote a lot of code without testing and by dinner time I had spent hours chasing my tail tracking down my own mistakes. On Sunday, after a similar day, I thought I'd completed the checkpoint correctly, but I hadn't. So I spent some of my Monday lab time fixing what I had done wrong. That was valuable time.
This week I've struggled specifically with MVC connections between files. Fortunately, it makes more sense every time I find a solution to a mistake I've made. Which I've done several times. But I completely blew it on Mondays lab. I'm pretty sure I wasn't exporting or importing something properly, which I had probably made worse when I changed the name on a controller, and then chased down every instance of it to add an s. I finally realized that I hadn't changed the name, I had created a new controller.    Facepalm. For sure.
I was struggling with a similar situation on Tuesdays lab project until Miles showed me how I could use cntrl. to prompt an export/import connection. I know I've heard Jeremy mention it in lecture but I never asked him to explain it further and didn't realize how important and helpful it could be.
After that small victory on Tuesday, and several other changes I made (correctly, I think) to my gregslist async lab project, my computer screen went dark. And I hadn't pushed my code since before I made those changes. After getting it up and running again I spent the next hour or so trying to figure out what I still had, and what I had lost. I finally got it back to a working state right before I went to fireside. When I got home Tuesday I thought I'd try again on Mondays lab.  I was unsuccessful.

- What would you count as a victory?
With every mistake that I make, I learn more about how to fix them, or avoid them altogether. I'd like to be performing better but I guess learning the hard way isn't all bad, as long as I'm learning. I'm looking forward to our one week break which I can hopefully use to catch up and maybe even revisit some of the projects that I'd like to improve on. But all that will have to wait until I complete my week 4 checkpoint. I haven't aced one yet. I'd really like to this time.
