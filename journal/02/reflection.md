# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I felt good about the whole week. Almost. Tuesday's lab was an exercise in frustration. But then on Wednesday, I learned A LOT. Had a tutor session with Jeremy that made a few things seem much clearer. Partnered with Arrington on Thursday and really enjoyed it. Very smart guy, very capable, but willing to slow down enough to talk through everything with me. Instead of just typing what he already knew had to be done, he would ask me what I thought we should do, and then ask me how to write it. That was very cool and it helped me to understand each step of what we were doing and why we were doing it.
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
I'm actually enjoying being around people. Really enjoying it. That's new.
Also, Jeremy started this process from absolute zero only about two years ago. That's crazy.
- What are you struggling with?
Time. I keep thinking I need just one more day to "catch up" and REALLY understand something, but that's not how this course works. I'm hoping I'll get more time to write code and study the other resources this weekend than I did last weekend. 
- What would you count as a victory?
I passed my first checkpoint. Only missed one req. Stupid rookie mistake on my part. But I passed it!
Also, I am thoroughly enjoying this. It's difficult and incredibly time consuming. But I don't feel lost. I think I'm keeping up. I count that as a win, for sure.
