# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I think I'm getting a good grasp on the mvc procedures, CRUD methods, and using Postman. It hasn't been a perfect week, but it was a good one.
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
"Playing" with my own code over the holiday break was a really great way to learn. I could break it on purpose just to fix it, and that was both educational and fun.
- What are you struggling with?
Speed. I am SO SLOW. Once I get set up and going, I think I do ok, but that first hour or so in lab I have trouble getting organized and getting going. I haven't quite figured out how to hit the ground running. Yet.  But I will.
- What would you count as a victory?
I finally aced a check-point. That felt pretty great. I'm not sure I could have done as well without all the extra time to do it, but that's ok. I needed the boost in confidence that I can get it done. If I can just figure out how to do it all a bit faster, I think I'll be in good shape.
