# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
 I learned a lot. Also, my anxiety about being around so many people so often is just about gone. I havent met anyone at codeworks that I dont like.
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
  I learned ABOUT mvc. I can't say I learned it, but I learned a lot about it. The amount of information was a bit shocking, but as a pleasant surprise, this week wasn't the hellish experience that the guys in the other class made it sound like.
- What are you struggling with?
 I feel like I'm working very slowly, so I try to go faster and I make mistakes. Big ones.
 I need to take the time to make sure I know the information. That is more important than completing a lab assignment.
- What would you count as a victory?
I passed my second checkpoint. It was ugly as sin, but it worked. I made one stupid mistake that I'll never forget.
And that's the point. To learn.
Also, Andrew and I worked really well together in Lab today. I think we made it as far as we could, relative to our skill level. I spent the final hour in a tutor session with Mick. I felt so much better about my understanding of mvc when i left his office.
I hope that translates in to a solid performance on the next checkpoint, which will be assigned tomorrow.
