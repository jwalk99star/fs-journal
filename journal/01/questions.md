# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > To save our code and share with others so multiple people can see and/or work on the same code.

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > Make directory.

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > One that requires interaction from the user. Probably the :hover button that turns colors when you hover over it, or the :before and :after buttons that would apply styling as a result of a user action.

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > It's a "ranking" system that signifies the importance of your code. Higher specificity will ensure one piece of code is honored above another piece, rather than just having the code read from top to bottom.

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > Overriding code that we want to run.

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > selector{
        property: value(argument)
    }

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > It improves the users experience. Convey importance and possibly(hopefully) engage the user to direct their use of the site.

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > To establish a basic idea of the look of the site or program and the job/responsibility of each visual component.

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > Yes. Planning is a key to success and having something visual to direct your tasks and their importance is typically better than winging it.

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > The ability to move things around the page in rows and columns.

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > padding, border, margin are the ones we see in the dev tools box model, but to be thorough in my answer - height & width also apply.
